# Atom-v1
  Atom is a vertical spinner, 3lb combat robot designed to deal out massive amounts of damage without dying itself. My second combat robot design, it was started in January of 2022 and is set to compete on May 14 at Norwalk Havoc Robot League (NHRL). Atom's 3/8" weapon weighs in at 230g spinning at 257mph, creating fairly large hits when at full speed but due to gyroscopic dancing, this will likely not be used often, there is also an option for a 1/2" weapon, but it will most likely not be used in combat due to its increased spin up time and a much higher likelihood of destroying itself, although it does weight around 300g. All weapons for this bot are designed to be cut from AR500 from SendCutSend. Atom has also been designed to be semi-modular in terms of its weapon choices, although it is limited to only vertical spinner options at the moment. This can be utilized with smaller diameter weapons that spin fast or even slighly larger diameter weapons for those massive hits, although this is not something that has been worked on yet.
